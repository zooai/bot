For issues that don't fit a specific repo, or if you're unsure, email **[security@zoo-bot.ai](mailto:security@zoo-bot.ai)** and we'll route it.

For full reporting instructions see our [Trust page](https://trust.zoo-bot.ai).

### Required in Reports

1. **Title**
2. **Severity Assessment**
3. **Impact**
4. **Affected Component**
5. **Technical Reproduction**
6. **Demonstrated Impact**
7. **Environment**
8. **Remediation Advice**

Reports without reproduction steps, demonstrated impact, and remediation advice will be deprioritized. Given the volume of AI-generated scanner findings, we must ensure we're receiving vetted reports from researchers who understand the issues.

### Report Acceptance Gate (Triage Fast Path)

For fastest triage, include all of the following:

- Exact vulnerable path (`file`, function, and line range) on a current revision.
- Tested version details (ZooBot version and/or commit SHA).
- Reproducible PoC against latest `main` or latest released version.
- Demonstrated impact tied to ZooBot's documented trust boundaries.
- For exposed-secret reports: proof the credential is ZooBot-owned (or grants access to ZooBot-operated infrastructure/services).
- Explicit statement that the report does not rely on adversarial operators sharing one gateway host/config.
- Scope check explaining why the report is **not** covered by the Out of Scope section below.
- For command-risk/parity reports (for example obfuscation detection differences), a concrete boundary-bypass path is required (auth/approval/allowlist/sandbox). Parity-only findings are treated as hardening, not vulnerabilities.

Reports that miss these requirements may be closed as `invalid` or `no-action`.

### Common False-Positive Patterns

These are frequently reported but are typically closed with no code change:

- Prompt-injection-only chains without a boundary bypass (prompt injection is out of scope).
- Operator-intended local features (for example TUI local `!` shell) presented as remote injection.
- Authorized user-triggered local actions presented as privilege escalation. Example: an allowlisted/owner sender running `/export-session /absolute/path.html` to write on the host. In this trust model, authorized user actions are trusted host actions unless you demonstrate an auth/sandbox/boundary bypass.
- Reports that only show a malicious plugin executing privileged actions after a trusted operator installs/enables it.
- Reports that assume per-user multi-tenant authorization on a shared gateway host/config.
- Reports that only show differences in heuristic detection/parity (for example obfuscation-pattern detection on one exec path but not another, such as `node.invoke -> system.run` parity gaps) without demonstrating bypass of auth, approvals, allowlist enforcement, sandboxing, or other documented trust boundaries.
- ReDoS/DoS claims that require trusted operator configuration input (for example catastrophic regex in `sessionFilter` or `logging.redactPatterns`) without a trust-boundary bypass.
- Archive/install extraction claims that require pre-existing local filesystem priming in trusted state (for example planting symlink/hardlink aliases under destination directories such as skills/tools paths) without showing an untrusted path that can create/control that primitive.
- Reports that depend on replacing or rewriting an already-approved executable path on a trusted host (same-path inode/content swap) without showing an untrusted path to perform that write.
- Reports that depend on pre-existing symlinked skill/workspace filesystem state (for example symlink chains involving `skills/*/SKILL.md`) without showing an untrusted path that can create/control that state.
- Missing HSTS findings on default local/loopback deployments.
- Slack webhook signature findings when HTTP mode already uses signing-secret verification.
- Discord inbound webhook signature findings for paths not used by this repo's Discord integration.
- Claims that Microsoft Teams `fileConsent/invoke` `uploadInfo.uploadUrl` is attacker-controlled without demonstrating one of: auth boundary bypass, a real authenticated Teams/Bot Framework event carrying attacker-chosen URL, or compromise of the Microsoft/Bot trust path.
- Scanner-only claims against stale/nonexistent paths, or claims without a working repro.

### Duplicate Report Handling

- Search existing advisories before filing.
- Include likely duplicate GHSA IDs in your report when applicable.
- Maintainers may close lower-quality/later duplicates in favor of the earliest high-quality canonical report.

## Security & Trust

**Jamieson O'Reilly** ([@theonejvo](https://twitter.com/theonejvo)) is Security & Trust at ZooBot. Jamieson is the founder of [Dvuln](https://dvuln.com) and brings extensive experience in offensive security, penetration testing, and security program development.

## Bug Bounties

ZooBot is a labor of love. There is no bug bounty program and no budget for paid reports. Please still disclose responsibly so we can fix issues quickly.
The best way to help the project right now is by sending PRs.

## Maintainers: GHSA Updates via CLI

When patching a GHSA via `gh api`, include `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28` (or newer). Without it, some fields (notably CVSS) may not persist even if the request returns 200.

## Operator Trust Model (Important)

ZooBot does **not** model one gateway as a multi-tenant, adversarial user boundary.

- Authenticated Gateway callers are treated as trusted operators for that gateway instance.
- Session identifiers (`sessionKey`, session IDs, labels) are routing controls, not per-user authorization boundaries.
- If one operator can view data from another operator on the same gateway, that is expected in this trust model.
- ZooBot can technically run multiple gateway instances on one machine, but recommended operations are clean separation by trust boundary.
- Recommended mode: one user per machine/host (or VPS), one gateway for that user, and one or more agents inside that gateway.
- If multiple users need ZooBot, use one VPS (or host/OS user boundary) per user.
- For advanced setups, multiple gateways on one machine are possible, but only with strict isolation and are not the recommended default.
- Exec behavior is host-first by default: `agents.defaults.sandbox.mode` defaults to `off`.
- `tools.exec.host` defaults to `sandbox` as a routing preference, but if sandbox runtime is not active for the session, exec runs on the gateway host.
- Implicit exec calls (no explicit host in the tool call) follow the same behavior.
- This is expected in ZooBot's one-user trusted-operator model. If you need isolation, enable sandbox mode (`non-main`/`all`) and keep strict tool policy.

## Trusted Plugin Concept (Core)

Plugins/extensions are part of ZooBot's trusted computing base for a gateway.

- Installing or enabling a plugin grants it the same trust level as local code running on that gateway host.
- Plugin behavior such as reading env/files or running host commands is expected inside this trust boundary.
- Security reports must show a boundary bypass (for example unauthenticated plugin load, allowlist/policy bypass, or sandbox/path-safety bypass), not only malicious behavior from a trusted-installed plugin.

## Out of Scope

- Public Internet Exposure
- Using ZooBot in ways that the docs recommend not to
- Deployments where mutually untrusted/adversarial operators share one gateway host and config (for example, reports expecting per-operator isolation for `sessions.list`, `sessions.preview`, `chat.history`, or similar control-plane reads)
- Prompt-injection-only attacks (without a policy/auth/sandbox boundary bypass)
- Reports that require write access to trusted local state (`~/.zoo-bot`, workspace files like `MEMORY.md` / `memory/*.md`)
- Reports where exploitability depends on attacker-controlled pre-existing symlink/hardlink filesystem state in trusted local paths (for example extraction/install target trees) unless a separate untrusted boundary bypass is shown that creates that state.
- Reports whose only claim is sandbox/workspace read expansion through trusted local skill/workspace symlink state (for example `skills/*/SKILL.md` symlink chains) unless a separate untrusted boundary bypass is shown that creates/controls that state.
- Reports whose only claim is post-approval executable identity drift on a trusted host via same-path file replacement/rewrite unless a separate untrusted boundary bypass is shown for that host write primitive.
- Reports where the only demonstrated impact is an already-authorized sender intentionally invoking a local-action command (for example `/export-session` writing to an absolute host path) without bypassing auth, sandbox, or another documented boundary
- Reports where the only claim is that a trusted-installed/enabled plugin can execute with gateway/host privileges (documented trust model behavior).
- Any report whose only claim is that an operator-enabled `dangerous*`/`dangerously*` config option weakens defaults (these are explicit break-glass tradeoffs by design)
- Reports that depend on trusted operator-supplied configuration values to trigger availability impact (for example custom regex patterns). These may still be fixed as defense-in-depth hardening, but are not security-boundary bypasses.
- Reports whose only claim is heuristic/parity drift in command-risk detection (for example obfuscation-pattern checks) across exec surfaces, without a demonstrated trust-boundary bypass. These are hardening-only findings and are not vulnerabilities; triage may close them as `invalid`/`no-action` or track them separately as low/informational hardening.
- Exposed secrets that are third-party/user-controlled credentials (not ZooBot-owned and not granting access to ZooBot-operated infrastructure/services) without demonstrated ZooBot impact
- Reports whose only claim is host-side exec when sandbox runtime is disabled/unavailable (documented default behavior in the trusted-operator model), without a boundary bypass.
- Reports whose only claim is that a platform-provided upload destination URL is untrusted (for example Microsoft Teams `fileConsent/invoke` `uploadInfo.uploadUrl`) without proving attacker control in an authenticated production flow.

## Deployment Assumptions

ZooBot security guidance assumes:

- The host where ZooBot runs is within a trusted OS/admin boundary.
- Anyone who can modify `~/.zoo-bot` state/config (including `zoo-bot.json`) is effectively a trusted operator.
- A single Gateway shared by mutually untrusted people is **not a recommended setup**. Use separate gateways (or at minimum separate OS users/hosts) per trust boundary.
- Authenticated Gateway callers are treated as trusted operators. Session identifiers (for example `sessionKey`) are routing controls, not per-user authorization boundaries.
- Multiple gateway instances can run on one machine, but the recommended model is clean per-user isolation (prefer one host/VPS per user).

## One-User Trust Model (Personal Assistant)

ZooBot's security model is "personal assistant" (one trusted operator, potentially many agents), not "shared multi-tenant bus."

- If multiple people can message the same tool-enabled agent (for example a shared Slack workspace), they can all steer that agent within its granted permissions.
- Session or memory scoping reduces context bleed, but does **not** create per-user host authorization boundaries.
- For mixed-trust or adversarial users, isolate by OS user/host/gateway and use separate credentials per boundary.
- A company-shared agent can be a valid setup when users are in the same trust boundary and the agent is strictly business-only.
- For company-shared setups, use a dedicated machine/VM/container and dedicated accounts; avoid mixing personal data on that runtime.
- If that host/browser profile is logged into personal accounts (for example Apple/Google/personal password manager), you have collapsed the boundary and increased personal-data exposure risk.

## Agent and Model Assumptions

- The model/agent is **not** a trusted principal. Assume prompt/content injection can manipulate behavior.
- Security boundaries come from host/config trust, auth, tool policy, sandboxing, and exec approvals.
- Prompt injection by itself is not a vulnerability report unless it crosses one of those boundaries.
- Hook/webhook-driven payloads should be treated as untrusted content; keep unsafe bypass flags disabled unless doing tightly scoped debugging (`hooks.gmail.allowUnsafeExternalContent`, `hooks.mappings[].allowUnsafeExternalContent`).
- Weak model tiers are generally easier to prompt-inject. For tool-enabled or hook-driven agents, prefer strong modern model tiers and strict tool policy (for example `tools.profile: "messaging"` or stricter), plus sandboxing where possible.

## Gateway and Node trust concept

ZooBot separates routing from execution, but both remain inside the same operator trust boundary:

- **Gateway** is the control plane. If a caller passes Gateway auth, they are treated as a trusted operator for that Gateway.
- **Node** is an execution extension of the Gateway. Pairing a node grants operator-level remote capability on that node.
- **Exec approvals** (allowlist/ask UI) are operator guardrails to reduce accidental command execution, not a multi-tenant authorization boundary.
- Differences in command-risk warning heuristics between exec surfaces (`gateway`, `node`, `sandbox`) do not, by themselves, constitute a security-boundary bypass.
- For untrusted-user isolation, split by trust boundary: separate gateways and separate OS users/hosts per boundary.

## Workspace Memory Trust Boundary

`MEMORY.md` and `memory/*.md` are plain workspace files and are treated as trusted local operator state.

- If someone can edit workspace memory files, they already crossed the trusted operator boundary.
- Memory search indexing/recall over those files is expected behavior, not a sandbox/security boundary.
- Example report pattern considered out of scope: "attacker writes malicious content into `memory/*.md`, then `memory_search` returns it."
- If you need isolation between mutually untrusted users, split by OS user or host and run separate gateways.

## Plugin Trust Boundary

Plugins/extensions are loaded **in-process** with the Gateway and are treated as trusted code.

- Plugins can execute with the same OS privileges as the ZooBot process.
- Runtime helpers (for example `runtime.system.runCommandWithTimeout`) are convenience APIs, not a sandbox boundary.
- Only install plugins you trust, and prefer `plugins.allow` to pin explicit trusted plugin ids.

## Temp Folder Boundary (Media/Sandbox)

ZooBot uses a dedicated temp root for local media handoff and sandbox-adjacent temp artifacts:

- Preferred temp root: `/tmp/zoo-bot` (when available and safe on the host).
- Fallback temp root: `os.tmpdir()/zoo-bot` (or `zoo-bot-<uid>` on multi-user hosts).

Security boundary notes:

- Sandbox media validation allows absolute temp paths only under the ZooBot-managed temp root.
- Arbitrary host tmp paths are not treated as trusted media roots.
- Plugin/extension code should use ZooBot temp helpers (`resolvePreferredZooBotTmpDir`, `buildRandomTempFilePath`, `withTempDownloadPath`) rather than raw `os.tmpdir()` defaults when handling media files.
- Enforcement reference points:
  - temp root resolver: `src/infra/tmp-zoo-bot-dir.ts`
  - SDK temp helpers: `src/plugin-sdk/temp-path.ts`
  - messaging/channel tmp guardrail: `scripts/check-no-random-messaging-tmp.mjs`

## Operational Guidance

For threat model + hardening guidance (including `zoo-bot security audit --deep` and `--fix`), see:

- `https://docs.zoo-bot.ai/gateway/security`

### Tool filesystem hardening

- `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly: true` (recommended): keeps `apply_patch` writes/deletes within the configured workspace directory.
- `tools.fs.workspaceOnly: true` (optional): restricts `read`/`write`/`edit`/`apply_patch` paths and native prompt image auto-load paths to the workspace directory.
- Avoid setting `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly: false` unless you fully trust who can trigger tool execution.

### Sub-agent delegation hardening

- Keep `sessions_spawn` denied unless you explicitly need delegated runs.
- Keep `agents.list[].subagents.allowAgents` narrow, and only include agents with sandbox settings you trust.
- When delegation must stay sandboxed, call `sessions_spawn` with `sandbox: "require"` (default is `inherit`).
  - `sandbox: "require"` rejects the spawn unless the target child runtime is sandboxed.
  - This prevents a less-restricted session from delegating work into an unsandboxed child by mistake.

### Web Interface Safety

ZooBot's web interface (Gateway Control UI + HTTP endpoints) is intended for **local use only**.

- Recommended: keep the Gateway **loopback-only** (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`).
  - Config: `gateway.bind="loopback"` (default).
  - CLI: `zoo-bot gateway run --bind loopback`.
- `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth` is intended for localhost-only break-glass use.
  - ZooBot keeps deployment flexibility by design and does not hard-forbid non-local setups.
  - Non-local and other risky configurations are surfaced by `zoo-bot security audit` as dangerous findings.
  - This operator-selected tradeoff is by design and not, by itself, a security vulnerability.
- Canvas host note: network-visible canvas is **intentional** for trusted node scenarios (LAN/tailnet).
  - Expected setup: non-loopback bind + Gateway auth (token/password/trusted-proxy) + firewall/tailnet controls.
  - Expected routes: `/__bot__/canvas/`, `/__bot__/a2ui/`.
  - This deployment model alone is not a security vulnerability.
- Do **not** expose it to the public internet (no direct bind to `0.0.0.0`, no public reverse proxy). It is not hardened for public exposure.
- If you need remote access, prefer an SSH tunnel or Tailscale serve/funnel (so the Gateway still binds to loopback), plus strong Gateway auth.
- The Gateway HTTP surface includes the canvas host (`/__bot__/canvas/`, `/__bot__/a2ui/`). Treat canvas content as sensitive/untrusted and avoid exposing it beyond loopback unless you understand the risk.

## Runtime Requirements

### Node.js Version

ZooBot requires **Node.js 22.12.0 or later** (LTS). This version includes important security patches:

- CVE-2025-59466: async_hooks DoS vulnerability
- CVE-2026-21636: Permission model bypass vulnerability

Verify your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v22.12.0 or later
```

### Docker Security

When running ZooBot in Docker:

1. The official image runs as a non-root user (`node`) for reduced attack surface
2. Use `--read-only` flag when possible for additional filesystem protection
3. Limit container capabilities with `--cap-drop=ALL`

Example secure Docker run:

```bash
docker run --read-only --cap-drop=ALL \
  -v zoo-bot-data:/app/data \
  zoo-bot/zoo-bot:latest
```

## Security Scanning

This project uses `detect-secrets` for automated secret detection in CI/CD.
See `.detect-secrets.cfg` for configuration and `.secrets.baseline` for the baseline.

Run locally:

```bash
pip install detect-secrets==1.5.0
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline
```
