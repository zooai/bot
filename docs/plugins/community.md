This page tracks high-quality **community-maintained plugins** for Bot.

We accept PRs that add community plugins here when they meet the quality bar.

## Required for listing

- Source code is hosted on GitHub (public repository).
- Repository includes setup/use docs and an issue tracker.

## How to submit

Open a PR that adds your plugin to this page with:

- Plugin name
- npm package name
- GitHub repository URL
- One-line description
- Install command

## Review bar

We prefer plugins that are useful, documented, and safe to operate.
Low-effort wrappers, unclear ownership, or unmaintained packages may be declined.
